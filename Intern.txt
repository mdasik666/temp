Subject: Internship request for my brother [Name]
Hi @Ganesh,
I am writing to inquire about potential internship opportunities for my brother, who is currently a final year B.E. student at K. Ramakrishnan College of Technology. As part of the curriculum, all students are required to complete an internship during their final year.

The internship will take place from [Start Date] to [End Date] and will be a valuable learning experience for my brother. He will be able to apply theoretical concepts to practical problems and gain industry insights.

We would be grateful if you could consider my brother for an internship position in our organization.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Thanks,
